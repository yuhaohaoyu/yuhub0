LESSON: RHEL82, check the firewall setting and adjust:

	- according to https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/957

	- Firewall issue

	- steps:

	fast workaround
		sudo nano /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf
			in config file change
				FirewallBackend=nftables
			to
				FirewallBackend=iptables
		save change and reload firewalld
			sudo systemctl restart firewalld.service


PAIN led to the lesson:

	This was after 
		recreate a VM, 
		reinstall rhel82
		reinstall docker-ce (involving purging podman and buildah)
		

	Trying fix:
		- according to # https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22635
			enabling MTU probing in the kernel resolved the issue. To enable it just run:
				sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing=1

			To make this permanently, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
				net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing=1

		- Did not fix

	Trying fix 2:
		- according to https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/611#issuecomment-365023640
		- restart docker

		make cluster-down
		docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
		docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
		systemctl restart docker

		- Did not fix

	Trying fix 3 : 
		- according to https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/957

		- Firewall issue

		- steps:

		fast workaround
			sudo nano /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf
				in config file change
					FirewallBackend=nftables
				to
					FirewallBackend=iptables
			save change and reload firewalld
				sudo systemctl restart firewalld.service
