PR4546, https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/4546, is tested in downstream environment. 

==================================================
The test in downstream environment is composed of:
==================================================
(1) OCP cluster: quicklab openshift4upi cluster, 1 executor node, 3 master nodes, 2 worker nodes, running OpenShift 4.6 with CNV 2.5.1
	- quicklab URL: https://quicklab.upshift.redhat.com/clusters/23853
(2) Mid-stream build container images: used the virt-launcher and virt-handler images. 
	- mid-stream build URL: https://code.engineering.redhat.com/gerrit/#/c/219475/
(3) Functional test: mostly followed Kedar's howto write-up
	- howto URL: https://source.redhat.com/personal_blogs/running_kubevirt_tests_for_cnvdownstream_setups

===================
Experiment factors:
===================
(1) Container images:
	(a) CNV-2.5.1 launcher/handler: Use the virt-launcher and the virt-handler images deployed by the quicklab deployment process, CNV 2.5.1
	(b) PR4546 launcher/handler: Use the virt-launcher and the virt-handler images built via code.engineering.redhat.com. (It appears that quicklab cluster can not directly pull images from registr-proxy.engineering.redhat.com. The images were pre-loaded to docker.io)
(2) Functest specs:
	(a) "[test_id:1668]should use EFI" test in vmi_configuration_test.go: asks for the OVMF_CODE.fd, which does not exist in the downstream container-disk of virt-launcher, but exists in the upstream virt-launcher.
	(b) "[test_id:4437]should enable EFI secure boot" test in vmi_configuration_test.go: asks for the OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd, which exists in both the downstream and upstream container-disks of virt-launcher.

Experiment results:
===================
(1) Container-image = CNV-2.5.1; test_id:1668 
    - test fails after 200 seconds, with following message:
	      Unexpected Warning event received: testvmijxgcsnd2xbktb7qj2chlhmpzwd4x2kxgnr95mgvrs6hkbv9f,48631439-6272-4ba5-962c-7eb75818d50f: server error. command SyncVMI failed: "LibvirtError(Code=1, Domain=10, Message='internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2020-12-04T18:54:29.717293Z qemu-kvm: -blockdev {\"driver\":\"file\",\"filename\":\"/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd\",\"node-name\":\"libvirt-pflash0-storage\",\"auto-read-only\":true,\"discard\":\"unmap\"}: Could not open '/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd': No such file or directory')"
	      Expected

(2) Container-image = PR4546; test_id:1668
    - test passes in 20 seconds (with the error handled by the PR and interpreted by the test code)

(3) Container-image = CNV-2.5.1; test_id:4437
    - test passes in 60 seconds (the guest VM booted with EFI secure boot)

(4) Container-image = PR4546; test_id:4437
    - test passes in 60 seconds (the guest VM booted with EFI secure boot)
